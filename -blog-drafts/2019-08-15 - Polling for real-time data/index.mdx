** Building a simple Twitter clone in React **

_hier nog klein beetje tekst?..._

> TLDR; / Spoiler Alert:

> Before writing this post I thought I would just explore the ```useEffect``` hook, 
but along the way I encountered the ```useCallback``` too, which gave me (and 
possibly you too) some nice insights! :)

In my React workshop for beginners I learn the participants how to create a simple 
Twitter clone from scratch. By the end of the workshop we have an app that displays 
the user's timeline and a form to post new messages which appear on the timeline. 
And because all users are following each other it appears on their timeline too.

For posting new messages I use _optimistic updates_, which means after posting a new
message it is added to state first, which causes a re-render resulting in the message
being displayed in the app right away, followed by posting the message to the REST API 
I built.

Because that API call almost never fails the user experiences a very snappy app because
you don't have to wait for the server to finish handling storing the message. And in 
a rare case the API call fails the app will restore the timeline to its original state.

So now you might wonder when and how is that timeline retrieved from the server? 
This is done when opening the app and after refreshing the page.

Some participants also added a GET call after posting the message from the server, 
so other posts that were added by other users in the mean time would also appear on 
the timeline.

While this is a nice start, the next logical step would be to make the app 
_realtime_, so that refreshing the timeline does not only depend on user actions. 

However, as my workshops are during the evening, getting this far in building an 
app that does all this was already quite a struggle for most participants.

** !!! NEWS FLASH !!! **

After giving some evening workshops me and my employer came up with the idea of expanding 
my workshops into a full day training! 

For me this is very exciting because I can take teaching (and learning, for that matter) 
React to a next level.

I really like doing this as I learn a lot from it, both as a person and to solidify what
I learn about React. Having all day I can not only explain things in more detail but also 
add some new subjects.

And last but not least, participants have more time working on assignments and exploring
React, because it's a hands-on DIY training.

One of the new subjects might be making the app realtime. This blog post is about 
finding a way how to do that in a *simple* way.

The objective of my workshops is to learn React and not some very advanced and 
time-consuming architectural solution. There are other courses to learn about that.

** Polling to the rescue **

The most simple solution I can come up with is polling each x seconds to the server and
ask whether there are new posts.

There are two ways of polling, the first is _short polling_, which means the client asks 
for new posts, the server answers and the connection is closed. 

And then there is _long polling_, which means the connection to the server is kept open 
and the server answers as soon as there are new posts.

Polling means the client takes the initiative to _pull_ data from the server. There are 
also patterns where the server _pushes_ data to the client, such as WebSockets and 
Server-Sent Events (SSE).

If you are looking for a _real_ realtime solution the server push patterns are definitely 
the way to go.

But as I said, I am looking for a simple solution, so I choose _short polling_, which 
makes the app _realtime-ish_, which is good enough for me considering the learning curve
and effort.

** Let's get started **

We want to retrieve the timeline when the app is opened for the first time, i.e. when the 
component is mounted. As a consequence the timeline will also be retrieved when the page 
is refreshed.

What a React component only does in essence is rendering UI and responding to user events, 
which in turn could cause a new re-render because state might have changed. The fact that
we want to do something that is not a user event means we are dealing with a side effect.

And therefore we need the ```useEffect``` hook to fetch the data:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  axios
    .get("https://example.com/timeline")
    .then(res => {
      setTimeline(res.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log(error, error.request, error.response, error.config);
    });
}, []);
```

The first argument of the ```useEffect``` is an inline function that calls the 
server and sets the received posts as state. The second is an empty array, which 
means the effect is called on the first render only.

Nice, so now retrieving the timeline when opening (or refreshing) the app works.

** Add polling **

Polling in our case means calling the server every x seconds. And the fact
that our component needs to do something based on _time_ is also a _side effect_, 
so we have to create another ```useEffect``` which also calls the REST API.

Let's refactor the code that retrieves the timeline by putting it into a new function 
called ```getTimeline``` so it becomes reusable:

```js
function getTimeline() {
  axios
    .get("https://example.com/timeline")
    .then(res => {
      setTimeline(res.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log(error, error.request, error.response, error.config);
    });
}
```

And call that in our existing ```useEffect```:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  getTimeline();
}, []);
```

Next, let's create a new ```useEffect``` for calling the REST API every x seconds. 

This ```useEffect``` uses javascript's ```setInterval``` to call the ```getTimeline``` 
function every 10 seconds. And because an interval needs to be cleaned up after using it
we return a function to do just that. React will call that function when the component 
unmounts.

The second argument is an empty array (again) because we want to set up this 
interval once, on the first render.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    getTimeline();      
  }, 10000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

And there you have it, a very simple realtime-ish app, very nice!

** Versioning the data on the server **

What our code does is fetching the entire timeline from the server every x seconds.
And replace the entire timeline state with that new timeline data. But because our app 
is not widely used yet this is a bit of waste of resources.

Let's improve this on the server by leveraging a caching strategy the HTTP protocol 
offers us:.

The timeline resource for each user on the server will get a _version number_. Every time 
a post is added to the timeline the version number is updated. Note that when a user posts 
a new message also the timelines of the users that are following the posting user will get 
a new version number.

The client will request the current timeline and besides the timeline itself, the server 
will provide the current version number for that timeline resource.

The client will keep track of that version number. Every time the client asks for 
the timeline it will provide that version number so the server can determine whether that 
version number is still the current version of the timeline on the server.

That version number is called an _ETag_ in HTTP land.

Only if the ETag has changed the server will return new data along with a ```200 OK``` 
status code. If not, the server will return a ```304 Not Modified``` status code without 
data indicating the client is up to date. In both cases the server will also return the 
current ETag.

The client sends its current ETag to the server with the ```If-None-Match``` header.

** Using the ETag in the client **

What we'll change in our ```getTimeline``` function is that it will only update the 
```timeline``` state if the server returns data. We determine that by looking at the 
```200 OK``` status code.

Also we need a way to store the current ETag version number on the client and send it 
along when requesting the timeline. We do that by adding ```etag``` to state. If the server 
responds with a different ETag we update the ````etag``` state.

```js
const [etag, setEtag] = useState(null);

/* (...) */

function getTimeline() {
  axios
    .get(settings.timelineUrl, {
      headers: { "If-None-Match": etag },
      validateStatus: function(status) {
        return status < 400; // All status codes below 400 are valid
      }
    })
    .then(res => {
      if (etag !== res.headers.etag) {
        setEtag(res.headers.etag);
      }
      if (res.status === 200) setTimeline(res.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log(error, error.request, error.response, error.config);
    });  
}
```

_Note: The ```validateStatus``` property is necessary to tell axios that besides 2xx 
status codes also 3xx status codes are valid._

Although this looks nice, our friend _eslint_ has something to say. Or as Kent C. Dodds 
would put it: "There's Dan Abramov looking over your shoulder telling you are using 
hooks wrong...":

> React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'getTimeline'. Either include it or 
remove the dependency array. (react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)

Removing the dependency array is not an option because that would mean our effect is executed 
on every render. We only want to execute it on mount. So let's add ```getTimeline``` to the 
dependency array.

_"But wait, why is this suddenly necessary?"_

First of all, if Dan, I mean eslint tells you to, just do it.

But there is also a good reason for it and that is because ```getTimeline``` is now using the 
state variable ```etag``` and state variables can (and so probably will) change. The fact that 
```getTimeline``` uses that variable in a closure means ```getTimeline``` itself also _changes_
when ```etag``` changes.

For our effects, ```getTimeline``` is a black box that will be called regularly and the effects 
count on the fact that the current, up to date ```etag``` is used when doing so.

So as soon as the etag is updated via setEtag, the component is re-rendered and the effects, 
that have the dependency on getTimeline, are in sync again. They can safely call getTimeline and 
know for sure that it is doing the API call with the current etag.

> And that is what the dependencies array is about: keeping things in sync.

Now you might say "yeah, nice, but it's too complicated, why don't you just let the effects 
pass that etag to getTimeline?" That could be a solution but then we would also have to move 
setting the etag coming from the response to state out of the function.

I think in that case I would suggest to move getTimeline out of the component and just make 
it completely stateless, to keep things clean and responsibilities clear. 

And that would mean a big refactor, which is not a bad thing, but I like the (React) learning 
effect on solving this problem within the component better.

So our effects now look like this, with getTimeline added as dependency:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  getTimeline();
}, [getTimeline]);

useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    getTimeline();
  }, 600000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [getTimeline]);
```

** ... title ... **

However, _eslint_ is still not satisfied. I get the following warning twice, for each effect:

> The 'getTimeline' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook change on 
every render. To fix this, wrap the 'getTimeline' definition into its own useCallback() Hook. 
(react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)

So we weren't completely there yet. We don't want that getTimeline changes on every render,
because that means the effects (which depend on getTimeline) are also called on every render.

Instead we want it only to change when ```etag``` changes. And we achieve that by wrapping the
implementation for getTimeline in a useCallback hook and passing ```etag``` as the second argument:

```js
const getTimeline = useCallback(() => {
  axios
    .get(settings.timelineUrl, {
      headers: { "If-None-Match": etag },
      validateStatus: function(status) {
        return status < 400; // All status codes below 400 are valid
      }
    })
    .then(res => {
      console.log(res.status);
      if (etag !== res.headers.etag) {
        setEtag(res.headers.etag);
      }
      if (res.status === 200) setTimeline(res.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.log(error, error.request, error.response, error.config);
    });
}, [etag]);
```

_hier een kort verhaaltje wat het algemene doel van useCallback is... Ik vind de naam niet erg logisch nu..._

** Conclusion **

With adding both the getTimeline dependency and ```useCallback```, we now no longer only call 
both effects on mount, we call them every time our _closured_ ```etag``` variable changes.

Cool, we made both the client and server more efficient. Our React component is not 
unnecesarily re-rendered every time and the server doesn't need to contact the database if 
it sees the client is already up date. And we reduced the amount data that needs to be 
transported over the network.

And last but least, we accidentally learned about a new hook. :D
