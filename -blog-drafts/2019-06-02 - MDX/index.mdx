Today I will practice my [MDX] capabilities. As I [blogged before], MDX is a format that
let's you write Markdown and JSX in one file, which means you are very flexible when
writing blog posts.

The blog post you are reading now is formatted in MDX too. So the reason I will practice
MDX today is to know how I can style my blog posts better. For example,
highlighting texts, showing code samples, etcetera. Just things to make my blog posts
look better and make them more readable. iets met dat het "uitnodigender" wordt...

The nice about MDX is you can not only style your text, you can also show how you do that
by displaying "the MDX code behind". Example:
